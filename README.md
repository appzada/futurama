# Futurama

A guide to this project.

## API

This app utilises the http package to access the Futurama API and standard API code to facilitate GET API calls – which are used in the app - as well as POST, DELETE (and so on) calls which are not used within the app. 

## DARK AND LIGHT MODES

The app uses ThemeData to alternative between light and dark themes. However, due to time constraints both theme colours are the same. The app will inform the user that they are in dark mode on the home page, by replacing the text ‘All Aboard’ with ‘Dark Mode Activated’.

## LANGUAGE LOCALISATION

The app will translate between English and Spanish. However, due to time constraints this is only coded for the Home Page language version text (bottom of the page), which will change from ‘English Version’ to ‘Versión en español’ if the device language settings are changed. Note: if running on an emulator the app may need to be stopped and restarted for changes to activate.

## QUIZ

The Quiz is designed to be indicative of the full quiz API. It incorporates 5 questions and a results screen.

## UI

The UI is designed to follow Futurama branding where applicable while incorporating a clean and modern primary text font. There is basic animation on the homepage. I considered Lottie animations but decided against as identifying a suitable animation to match the branding proved problematic. 

## SCREEN TESTING

The app has been tested on all screen sizes.
